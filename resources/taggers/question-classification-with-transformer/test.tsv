i've playing game times(one house) spent lot hours game since got it. xbox series x pc. honestly easily say new favourite game! long time hp fan, great fan hp. everything books mentioned(down crack step astronomy tower) visuals stunning, simply explore manage find something new. pros cons list.pros:-the graphics detail; tell avalanche put lot love game tell fans world.-the play ability; played game multiple times-the writing story, pretty solid. could explained student start 5th year.-room requirement; spent lot time growing brewing.-testing hp knowledge; loved idea there's trivia side quest game! ravenclaw student asking questions(ravenclaw represent)cons: (not really cons, would thought might maximize play quality game)-i really wished could put quidditch wizard's chess game.when first played harry potter philosopher's stone ps2, loved playing quidditch game seeing pitch game made long play it. wizard's chess, decent chess game would great see. -the lack missions common rooms. really wished reasons go back common room. think utilise enough common rooms.-nightly curfews; aside getting restrictive section library beginning demiguise mission, curfews there, night. would thought curfew would bit challenge coming home nightly excursions also adds challenge get caught. -dragon mounts; seen mods riding dragons looks amazing, would also would like add dragons vivarium breed. -more potions; felix felicis, polyjuice-patronises-years 6 7(be able choose prefect not)-more stuff room requirement: practice dummies spells.-there much blank space world map; really hope adding locations missions dlc example, like godric's hallow, founders homes, forest dean, diagon alley, burrow, minister magic, etc. also ability obtaining deathly hallows, loved teased it. missions death day parties house, like diving house ghosts, depth players history, parents? option make story get talk player live??? muggles? wizard family? orphaned? abandoned? what???in conclusion, game amazing! took back loving books movies. game rekindled love harry potter even more. really really hope add things game! can't tell enough much love game!

played dark souls, try imagine would wanted make game frustrating. hitstun lasts short amount time? well let's make mechanic every single hit stuns full second get hit repeatedly, game stun 10 seconds nothing it. oh let's give monsters roars spam repeatedly one another stun 5 seconds each.because capcoms way making game "difficult" designing punishing fair enemy movesets, instead removing control player every time take (often unavoidable) damage. bad game really difficult either. monster hunter pretty old franchise seems like they've never moved dated mechanics still plague games day. probably change future games either, mechanics considered "hard core" like "git gud". point obvious flaw fanboys tell "worse old games".

"no, want drive! ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥'s gonna take blind left turn, wreck car!" fact i'd rather fast travel drive really makes hard care buying cars.

i'll honest, every time encountered 'nornir' chest, made sigh. quasi every 2 meters there's puzzle. even hard, really tedious make want gauge eyes obviously busy work. mention ♥♥♥♥♥♥ loot inside - like devs spitting face. additionally, map traversal felt clunky slow. fun rowing life away changing realms. cringed whenever saw chain press e knowing i'll animation locked felt like eternity. i'll pray completionist lot backtracking. pleasant. expected combat, felt rather bland. also expected lot bloodshed epic boss battles. shame. first one even count tutorial - literally 0 skills keep slashing slashing slashing and.... slashing game decides enough. another point want make: enemies damage sponges. irritating, just... why. let 1 shot low-level enemies maxed kratos, pls.some bigger story enemies boss battles gimmicky involve skill, timing thought, really. i've heard positive things optional bosses, reskins/different colored versions other; interesting. laughable lack enemy variety - ice fire types. yay!the inevitable backtracking (and trust me, there's lot it) also another aspect makes roll eyes. pain aforementioned traversal hassle. things make game feel like one big chore. force parts. ui weird kratos' idea father be.what irks probably fov. awful feels like torture.the story simple enough. say masterpiece like mouth-frothers claiming be. voice-acting graphics good. mimir definitely saving grace.overall, understand game 10/10? 6 - 7/10 best. -지루한 퍼즐-느린 맵 이동-많은 역 추적-지루한 전투-서사시적인 보스 전투는 많지 않습니다-짜증나는 아들-간단한 이야기-좋은 그래픽

multiplayer story coop game probably worst implementation ever seen. 1) main story quests locked 1/1 players watched cutscene1.1) main story quests seems cutscene2) friend cant join unless also seen cutscene3) everyone party individually seen damn cutscene, everyone except one person needs return quest hub wait last person send flare (this allowes friends join session).4) needs done every single quest.i clue developers thought decided implement this. utterly trash fixed.bought game 2 friends find cant really play story together. please remove co-op tag steam. isnt co-op game, multiplayer sure... co-op (unless want keep step 1-4 every single quest). would recommend incomplete, badly designed piece trash dog ass game....

good game. great one, decent one. unfortunately, despite can't recommend it.from i've seen online, problems game vary greatly individual individual. people absolutely errors game, though i'm sceptical. personally, game crashes entire computer regular. good computer.there things reduce frequency crashes. honestly forget half are. think turning raytracing one them? applying changes, worst crashes every ten minutes so. yes, entire computer. single crash game crashed computer. know why. game this.everything risky game. alt+tab out? crash. craft iconic weapon try upgrade something? crash. try upgrade something like twice row? crash. trying save game? sometimes even crashes it. course, sometimes randomly middle combat.putting aside crashes, minor glaring problems game.for starters, get main menu press space twice. unecessary. use mod remove one. then, glitches quests. ungodly reason, several quests say 'wait x' 'wait day'. problem, there's wait feature, right? well, yes, no. actually, restart entire game trigger continue. know why. main quest stuff. like released yesterday. fixed ages ago.and small peeve, there's crafting lot things game. except scopes muzzles. for... reason. way get high quality scopes literally get lucky. appear shops, still random qualities better bet wandering around. anyway good luck that.tl;dr: wait another couple years, crashes damned place.

judging recommending game, read review first. stardew valley great rpg game, really fun start, but, playing, noticed game would never end. many things game takes long time do, simply give middle gameplay. stardew valley "working simulator", thing game work boring things, sometimes go different in-game events changes vibe bit, end really fast. work much game going stress someday, simply give playing, start notice playing game living life, start think working virtual video-game real life. stardew valley nice vibe, characters objects game actually really creative, going get tired easily, repetitive. > graphics:-they're simple nice, pixel art graphics. play computer.> enjoyment:-you lot enjoyment start, hours, going get really tired giving game repetitive.> controls:-easy learn they're simple.> story:-really creative.> learn play:-depends player, recommend searching stardew valley tutorial playing.> difficulty: -i know game simple farming game, actually pretty hard. enemies hard, hard get materials build things, hard fish, hard almost everything. need lot patience play game.> soundtracks:-great soundtracks! give different emotions make vibe lot.> price:-it's good price.> recommend buying it:-in opinion, that's good idea. like said, game repetitive, going work lot, get stressed easily spend looooong time life upgrade.> extra opinion:-stardew valley rpg farming simulator, great characters, great ambience, great soundtrack really creative. game really good start, going make excited play more, long time, going realise never finish game many things do, going stressed probably give up. now, buying game you, think worth try.

love monster hunter death, game included. i'm going keep playing hell it.but absolutely cannot good conscience recommend others, current state.if look comments, see exactly problems everyone talking about. lack options, screwy multiplayer, etc etc.but comes controls. game like monster hunter, lives dies controls. oh boy bad. pretty simple reason: designed top bottom controller, mouse keyboard mind. fact, would go limb say probably map mouse keyboard inputs virtual controller, use actual inputs game. specific reasons that. interested, here's section it, feel free skip it.-skippable-----------first feature lot reviewers refer mouse acceleration. mention like reverse-acceleration. essentially, swipe mouse fast spin around, start turn, smoothly turn set speed continue move mouse. essentially, seems mapping far move mouse, virtual stick, move maximum value stick, turn value capped. also explains turn sensitivity, max turn rate increases well. theoretically, could turn sensitivity max virtual stick's limit higher could reasonably move mouse, except increasing overall sensitivity, causes movements incredibly amplified. personally, found sweet spot 65, fast, run upper limit often, again, that's love game death way willing put with/ignore massive flaws design.update 9/28/18: particular issues fixed, good job capcom!i started type section button configuration, second thought, way specific funtions work makes think mouselook that's handled virtual joystick.--------as keyboard inputs: believe specifically handled virtual controller, designed completely use controller scheme already established. going confusing, really confusing:your 'activate' button left mouse button (going defaults here). left click talk people, open storage box everything, cool. equivalent controller 'x' seems. right click canceling speech/menus/etc. equivalent 'b'. go quest attack button 'x' meaning left click m&k. means can't use speak people interact things anymore, since need button draw weapon. got put 'b', right mouse button. still cancel menus too. means that, kid not, every time got hunt, go storage box, left click open it, get items need, leave hunt, run supply box, left click smack sword. every. single. time.update 9/28/18: 150 hours in, still hunts.and problem may wondering? well, need use left click right click first place? control scheme even considered all? e key interact everything like every pc first game there. e talk, e grab things, e open box, e go doorways. different buttons share inputs unrelated actions depending circumstances, modes, quests, etc etc etc. one button one type action. that's pc game controls work ~70 buttons work (multiply 7 include modifier keys), 8.update 9/28/18: i've since picked gunner oh boy controls even nightmare. attack combos using reload button keyboard combination various inputs, multiple buttons attacks cases all, manner nightmarish problems stemming using controller configurations. mention default disabling ability basically choose items gunner. sheer insanity key rebininding make playable, even using 11 button gaming mouse, makes shudder thinking it.tldrthe long short games depend heavily controls. port made mouse keyboard controls mimicking controller based controls way through. makes controlling game absolute nonsensical clusterf*ck.i can't recommend something fails single important aspect game, people, matter much love myself.

put 10 hours deciding bothered anymore. connectivity problems like many negative reviews i've seen, get crashes (at least update drivers). problem monster hunter franchise one game design. good : overall game well put together. mechanics exactly expecting. crafting/upgrading nice intuitive feel overly grindy. say story compelling really game killing giant monsters so... good enough. graphics, let's say good console game. take will. always, collaborative play monster hunter shines that's different here. bad : many reviews talking combat exhilerating challenging... must perspective thing. i've beaten every souls-like i've ever gotten hands might coloring opinion, really find fights compelling. gave hunter rank 5 till every fight dodging televised attacks mashing attack back legs. choose make things harder really real challenge abysmal lock-on camera somewhat clunky combat controls (and needing sharpen weapons every 20-30 seconds apparently world blades made plastic). attacks really varied: easily dodged physical attacks specific special attacks need avoid. ugly : monster hunter games i've tried, monsters still run away times finally stay still die. course use projectiles break run-away sequence kill one spot takes figure without guide really way circumventing annoying mechanic. combined easy combat spend first 6-8 hours going cycle again: dodge hack legs 30 seconds (plus sharpen 2 good measure), chase monster bashing tail, repeat. conclusion : overall, like took would good 15-20 hour game bit help needed combat controls stretched couple hundred hours idiotic mechanics. would much rather much harder, faster-paced combat monsters more-or-less stick locations spend time chasing around easy bosses figured break game keeping one place. buying play friends, fine. looking good single player combat experience, bother.

there's really nothing positive say game.the "campaign" probably one mediocre, outright terrible storylines video game. understand grand scale wizarding world, forced exactly like harry potter movies much, took away "magic" it. like trying appeal children extremely limited attention span, nothing short terrible.on top that, story bad, nothing say actually really matters. interactive, thing happens is... nothing. sometimes get background important things, sometimes "major" things happens, nothing really happens matters. idea wrote this, never write anything ever again. ending cutscene incredibly short pointless, ends, left "what ♥♥♥♥?".while combat alright, nothing short extremely basic dark souls. roll, parry, attack. nothing extensive, nothing complex, incredibly disappointing line magic, magic slots barely any, also limited, talents. even know levels thing, easily kill multiple enemies 15 levels higher you.questionable design choices quidditch, taking ridiculous amount time unlock spells unless rush entire game, abysmal flying model makes want bother way, morality system, using "unforgivable" curses means absolutely nothing, dare say, really open world content aside puzzles loot. there's really point anything improve character, really matter grand scheme things. only, truly useful "side" content ancient magic traces increase bar meter, that's it.honestly, really nothing positive say. deeply disappointed would make game, based franchise, bad this. there's even basic, simple multiplayer screw around friends. game disguises open world game, really another linear story game. relics past, made anymore. player choice gives game replayability value, truly none here.

fun game play friends look elsewhere. hard join friends friend nearly complete mission join mission level higher. basic rundown friend play whole mission, track boss, finally he's found cut scene signal others join him. loading time time takes assistance run either boss friend probably already dead. like said fun game plan play friends coop non-existent. horrible multiplayer implementation.

buyer beware. still use old 4:3 ratio resolutions, buy game. support 4:3 here.high resolutions bright graphics cause get eyestrain (and headache). that's never healthy. shame, really. really looking forward properly playing game.hopefully dev decides add backwards-compatibility 1024x768, buy game heartbeat. right now, that's happening. probably never 4:3 phased out.

game pretty solid, exactly original titles; people tell played harvest moon game basically already played stardew valley too. they're right - unlike harvest moon, stardew valley suck. parts game "growing plants farm" done better (the growing plants farm part least equally good) also got somewhat steadier (and faster) pace. there's also fewer things make sense first time happen, although suppose surprised chicken coop raided witch fact good thing.i almost gripes game, delivers everything promises (and little bit places) almost fun.the older version review seriously criticized fishing minigame. since gotten gud, retract complaints; play fishing minigame mouse controller fine.
